# Bio-Signal-Analysis-for-Smoking-using-ML-
# Project Overview
- This project focuses on analyzing bio-signals to detect smoking habits using machine learning - models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Bio-signals may include physiological data like heart rate, skin temperature, or other sensor data, which can be used to predict whether an individual is smoking or not.

# Objective
- The main goal is to use machine learning algorithms to classify bio-signal data into two categories:

- Smoking
- Non-Smoking
- By applying logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models, the project aims to compare the accuracy and performance of these classifiers.
